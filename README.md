# gitexercise
First I opened my git account in my laptop using git config, then I started the exercise.
Then I added two files to staging area and commited only one out of those two as mentioned in the exercise.
Created a .gitignore file and added all the files in it that need to be ignored. ( * for extensions). Commited all the changes
Merged the branch to chase-branch using git merge.
To solve the merge conflict, I edited the .txt file and then merged.
First I saved the current work using git stash, fixed the big in bug.txt, stash popped, added the new line, commited changes.
for next exercise, I simply removed ignored.txt using rm from repository
Simply renamed the file (I have mac)
first I changed the typo in the file using vim 
Then I added and commited the previous file.
Rebased the branch
First i rebased in interactive environment so that I can edit any commit. Then i edited my file, added , commited and continued rebase. edited file to resolve conflict and added commits.
